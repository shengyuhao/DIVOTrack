# DIVOTrack: A Cross-View Dataset for Multi-Human Tracking in DIVerse Open Scenes

The DIVOTrack dataset was created by Gaoang Wang, Shengyu Hao, Yibing Zhan, Peiyuan Liu, Zuozhu Liu, Mingli Song and Hwang, Jenq-Neng. 
DIVOTrack is a novel cross-view multi-human tracking dataset which is more realistic and diverse, has more tracks, and incorporates moving cameras. Accordingly, a standardized benchmark is built for cross-view tracking, with clear split of training and testing set, publicly accessible detection, and standard cross-view tracking evaluation metrics. With the proposed dataset and benchmark, the cross-view tracking methods can be fairly compared in the future, which will improve the development of cross-view tracking techniques.
now made publicly available for 
research purpose only on a case-by-case basis. DIVOTrack is serving as the technical agent for distribution of the 
dataset and reserves the copyright of all the images in the database. Researchers who request the DIVOTrack 
dataset must sign this agreement and thereby agree to obey the restrictions listed in this document. Failure 
to observe the restrictions might result in access being denied for the request of the future version of the 
DIVOTrack dataset and being subject to civil damages in the case of publication of images that have not been 
approved for release. The researchers agree to the following restrictions on using DIVOTrack dataset: 


1. All the videos and images will be published or released in technical reports, or papers only. Any videos or 
images will never be released in commercial materials, newspapers, or other public media.
2. The dataset will not be re-distributed, published, copied, or further disseminated in any way or form 
whatsoever, whether for profit or not. This includes further distributing, copying, or disseminating to a 
different facility or organizational unit in the requesting university, organization, or company.
3. All the data in DIVOTrack dataset can only be used for the purpose of scientific researches. The DIVOTrack, in whole or in part, will not be used for any commercial purpose in any form.
4. All technical papers, documents and reports which used the DIVOTrack dataset should acknowledge the 
use of the database as follows: "The research in this paper used the DIVOTrack dataset collected by Zhejiang University." and provide citations to the corresponding article:
